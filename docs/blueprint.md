# **App Name**: Interactive 3D Chemical Experiment Lab (MVP)

## Core Features:

- Enhanced 3D Virtual Laboratory Environment: Render a basic, clean, and modern 3D lab bench, centrally positioned, with a designated area for the experiment. The bench should have subtle textures (e.g., polished concrete or dark wood) to enhance realism. Include a simple, minimalist background, such as a blurred laboratory wall or generic shelving, to provide spatial context without distracting from the main action. A fixed, optimal camera view that clearly frames the experiment area. Implement a very subtle, slow, continuous orbital rotation around the beaker (e.g., 0.005 radians per frame) to enhance the 3D perception, or a single toggle button for a slight, smooth zoom-in/out on the beaker.
- Essential Interactive Lab Equipment: Implement a single, transparent glass beaker (e.g., 250ml size), appropriately scaled and positioned on the lab bench. The beaker should contain a volume of clear water, rendered with subtle reflective and refractive qualities (e.g., using Three.js ShaderMaterial for realistic light interaction). Model a small, irregular chunk or cube of sodium metal, approximately 1-2 cm in size. It should appear dull, silvery-grey, and slightly oxidized on its surface, contrasting with a potential brighter interior if it were to break apart (though not required for MVP). Allow USER to 'add' the sodium metal to the water in the beaker via a single, prominent button click. The sodium piece should visually drop into the water with a realistic, albeit simplified, falling animation.
- Core Chemical Reaction Simulation (Sodium with Water): Simulate the reaction with synchronized visual and auditory effects: Implement a robust particle system for prominent, dynamic hydrogen gas bubbles. Bubbles should vary realistically in size (small to medium), speed, and buoyancy, rising from the sodium piece and breaking the water surface with a subtle splash particle effect. Generate a translucent, wispy, and voluminous smoke/steam effect rising rapidly from the reaction point. The volume of smoke should correspond to the intensity of the reaction, gradually dissipating into the air over time. Animate the sodium piece to 'skitter' and move rapidly, unpredictably, and erratically across the water surface during the active phase of the reaction, changing direction realistically as it reacts. A distinct, bright, and dynamic yellow-orange flame particle effect should appear directly around the sodium piece. The flame should flicker, pulsate, and vary in size and intensity, accurately reflecting the characteristic sodium flame. A subtle yet noticeable heat distortion or shimmer effect should be applied to the air directly above and around the reaction area, indicating significant energy release. This could be achieved with a post-processing shader. Integrate simple, synchronized sound effects using Tone.js: A gentle, continuous fizzing/bubbling sound as the reaction starts. A more rapid, intense hissing sound during the peak of the reaction. A distinct, small 'pop' or 'crackling' sound effect as the reaction intensifies and hydrogen ignites. Sounds should fade out as the reaction subsides. The reaction should have a clear, timed lifecycle: an initial drop, a rapid onset of the active phase (with all effects intensifying), a sustained peak, a gradual fading of effects, and a final cessation as the sodium is consumed (leaving a clear solution or a very small, dissolving residue). The total duration should be engaging but not overly long (e.g., 10-15 seconds).
- Minimal User Interface (UI): A clean, modern UI panel (e.g., a semi-transparent 'glassmorphism' effect) positioned unobtrusively at the bottom or side of the screen. A prominent, clearly labeled 'Drop Sodium' button to initiate the addition of the metal. This button should be disabled while a reaction is in progress. A 'Reset Experiment' button to immediately clear all reaction effects, remove any remaining sodium, and restore the beaker with fresh water, ready for a new experiment. This button should be enabled only after a reaction has started or completed. A small, clear text display (e.g., 'Ready,' 'Dropping Sodium...', 'Reacting...', 'Reaction Complete,' 'Experiment Reset') to provide simple, real-time feedback to the USER on the current state of the simulation.

## Style Guidelines:

- Utilize Three.js for all 3D scene rendering. Employ BufferGeometry for efficient custom models (lab bench, beaker). Use Points or InstancedMesh for optimized particle systems (bubbles, flame, smoke). Consider ShaderMaterial for advanced water rendering (reflection/refraction) and heat shimmer effects.
- React for managing the UI components, application state, and seamlessly integrating the Three.js canvas.
- Use Tailwind CSS extensively for all UI elements, ensuring a modern, responsive, and clean aesthetic with appropriate spacing, typography, and interactive states.
- Integrate Tone.js for precise control over sound playback, including loading short audio samples for fizzing, hissing, and popping effects, and managing their volume and timing.
- Implement complex, synchronized animations (sodium movement, particle lifecycles, flame dynamics) using Three.js's animation loop and potentially GSAP for smoother, timeline-based transitions and easing effects.
- Ensure the canvas and UI adapt gracefully to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) using relative units (%, vw, vh) and Tailwind's responsive breakpoints (sm:, md:, lg:). The canvas should dynamically resize to fill the available space.
- The sodium-water reaction must be visually clear, highly impactful, and immediately recognizable, conveying the energetic nature of the chemical process.
- While not photorealistic, the visual effects should convey a strong sense of chemical authenticity and dynamic energy, aiming for a 'stylized realism' that is both educational and engaging.
- The simulation must run smoothly without significant frame rate drops, even with multiple particle systems active, ensuring a fluid and immersive user experience.
- The UI should be extremely simple and straightforward, allowing USER to focus entirely on observing and understanding the experiment without any cognitive load from complex controls.
