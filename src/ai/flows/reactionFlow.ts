  Reactants: {{chemicals}}
  Temperature: {{temperature}}Â°C
  Concentration: {{concentration}}M

  Based on these inputs, provide the following:
  1. The name of the reaction. If sprays are used, you MUST give it a fun, descriptive, creative name (e.g. "Sparkling Volcano", "Graphene Mist").
  2. A clear, step-by-step description of the chemical process. Explain what is happening at a molecular level in simple, realistic terms.
  3. The chemical formulas of the main products and their physical state (solid, liquid, gas, or aqueous). If no reaction occurs, state that and list the original chemicals. Sprays don't create products but affect the visual description.
  4. A brief, important safety note or a fun fact.
  5. The visual effects of the final products (color, bubbles, smoke, sparkles, glow, explosion). Be creative but scientifically plausible. An explosion must be for a highly exothermic or volatile reaction (e.g., alkali metals in water).
  6. A "Visual Preview": A short, vivid, and imaginative text description of the final result, as if giving a demo.
  7. "Real-World Probability": Estimate the percentage chance of success vs. failure for this reaction in a real lab. Consider purity, conditions, etc. The two probabilities must sum to 100.
  8. "Destruction Scale": A 0-10 rating of the potential destructive power. 0 is inert, 10 is a catastrophic explosion.

  If the combination of chemicals does not react under the given conditions, state that clearly, but still describe the visual mixing.`,
