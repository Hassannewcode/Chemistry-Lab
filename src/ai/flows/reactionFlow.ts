  Based on these inputs, provide the following:
  1. The name of the reaction.
  2. A clear, step-by-step description of the chemical process. Explain what is happening at a molecular level in simple terms.
  3. The chemical formulas of the main products. If no reaction occurs, state that and list the original chemicals as the products.
  4. A brief, important safety note or a fun fact related to the reaction or chemicals involved.

  Keep the language accessible and engaging for a high school student.
  If the combination of chemicals does not typically react under the given conditions, state that clearly in the description.`,
